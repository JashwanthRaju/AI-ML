# AI-ML
AI/ML project using datasets from Kaggle, blending robotic knowledge with AI/ML, ability to think adjacent use cases by applying the learning and projects done in the past.

The dataset contains 5-years worth of product sales data. The goal is to effectively forecast the future sales of those products for the next 3-months. To achieve this goal we will be making use of a state-of-the-art gradient boosting algorithm as well as a python library called Upgini, for data enrichment.
